# Tensorflow/Keras/GPU for Chinese MNIST Prediction
As part of my learning journey, I made this project to predict the Chinese digits. I'm still in the early stages of learning machine learning and Tensorflow, so do not take it all as a "serious" reference ðŸ˜…

I still have not learned about convolutional (Conv2D) layers, that's why I dont use them in my model.
However, I hope it is still helpful for you, specially for people starting using Tensorflow as well as I am.
