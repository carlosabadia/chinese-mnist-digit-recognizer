# Tensorflow/Keras/GPU for Chinese MNIST Prediction
As part of my learning journey, I made this project to predict the Chinese digits. So do not take it all as a serious reference ðŸ˜….

I still have not learned about convolutional (Conv2D) layers, that's why I dont use them in my model.
However, I hope it is still helpful for you, specially for people starting using Tensorflow and CNN as well as I am.
